# Ensemble Learning with Semantic Feature Fusion
This repository contains resources related to the research titled "**Ensemble Learning Approach with Semantic Feature Fusion for Granular Nucleosome Position Mapping**."
This work emphased the spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the DNA sequence and proposed an ensemble learning model with semantic feature fusion. A detailed archtecture for the proposed framework which consists of core spaces including the Data Space, the Feature Fusion Space, and the Model Space.

**System model of the ensemble learning framework highlighting data, feature fusion, and model spaces**

## Data Space
The **Data Space** represents the continuous nature of DNA and RNA sequences and emphasizes the necessity of transforming these continuous chains into **semantic vector representations** through **tokenization and vectorization** processes. 

## Feature Fusion Space
The **semantic feature space** presents the cosine **semantic similarity mechanism** to characterize the semantic relationship among the vectorized tokens and subsequently **fuse the correlated features into a semantic vector** that is utilized in the developed framework.
