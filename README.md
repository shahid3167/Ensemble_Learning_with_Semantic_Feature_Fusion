# Ensemble Learning with Semantic Feature Fusion
This repository contains resources related to the research titled "**Ensemble Learning Approach with Semantic Feature Fusion for Granular Nucleosome Position Mapping**."
This work emphased the spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the DNA sequence and proposed an ensemble learning model with semantic feature fusion. A detailed archtecture for the proposed framework which consists of core spaces including the Data Space, the Feature Fusion Space, and the Model Space.

## Data Space
The **Data Space** represents the continuous nature of DNA and RNA sequences and emphasizes the necessity of transforming these continuous chains into **semantic vector representations** through **tokenization and vectorization** processes.
